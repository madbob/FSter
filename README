FSter - Configurable virtual filesystem for Tracker
===============================================================================

FSter is a virtual filesystem built on FUSE, able to dispose contents fetched
from Tracker according to a flexible XML configuration.

REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FSter depends on:

  - fuse >= 2.9.2
  - libxml2 >= 2.9.1
  - gio >= 2.36.4
  - gthreads >= 2.36.4

INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See INSTALL file.

USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ fster /your/preferred/mountpoint

By default, configuration is read from /etc/fster/fster.xml. To specify another
location
$ fster /your/preferred/mountpoint -c /path/to/configuration.xml

If filesystem stop responding (e.g. an `ls` command on your mountpoint replies
something like "Transport endpoint is not connected"), do
# fusermount -uz /your/preferred/mountpoint

CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FSter is configured by an XML file, formalized by the conf/FSter.xsd schema,
describing the desired hierarchy. In the conf/ folder you find some examples:

  - media.xml simply dispose all files in folders by their essential type
    (audio files, images and videos)
  - music.xml collects music files aggregated by album, artist or genre (by
    their ID3 tags)
  - commented.xml is a demostrative hierarchy, commented line by line, sporting
    most of the possibilities

In general, you have an <exposing_tree> in which are defined many nodes.

Some of them may contain other nodes, such as:

  - <folder> shows a folder for each RDF subject in the repository matching
    with defined conditions
  - <static_folder> shows a single folder with a static name
  - <set_folder> shows a folder for each value assumed by the specified RDF
    predicate in the store

Other kind of nodes cannot contain other items in configuration, such as:

  - <file> shows a file for each RDF subject in the repository matching with
    defined conditions
  - <mirror_content> maps 1:1 a folder from the effective filesystem, and all
    his underlaying hierarchy
  - <system_folders> do the same thing of <mirror_content base_path="/">
