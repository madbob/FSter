Copyright (C) 2010 Itsme S.r.l.

This file hold the installation instruction for FSter (Guglielmo hyper file 
system) developed by Itsme S.r.l. 
For details about configuration and running, please take a look at the wiki:

DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to compile and install FSter you need:
  - cmake >= 2.8.0
  - fuse >= 2.8.1
  - tracker-client >= 0.7.11
  - libxml2 >= 2.7.4


BASIC INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to install FSter is:

1) $ mkdir build

Create a directory where you want to compile your software. In this case the
newly created build directory is within the unpacked downloaded software.

2) $ cd build

3) $ cmake ..

From within the build directory call cmake pointing to the root of the
unpacked software.  While running cmake will check your prerequisites and 
create the makefiles.

4) $ make

Invoke the make program to build your software.

5) $ sudo make install

This command will install executables and libraries on your system. By default
the install will place executables and libraries under /usr/local.


DETAILS INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The build directory might have any name and be placed in any convenient 
location. In this case from the build directory you need to run cmake like
 cmake <path/to/root/source/tree>

2) Installation in user-specified directory.
To install FSter in a custom location you may want to use 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/my/target/installation" as an argument for cmake


3) Custom Tracker installation

Cmake will check for Tracker installation in both /usr and /usr/local. 
If your system has libraries in a different custom path you need to make 
sure of the following steps:

3.a) pass -DTRACKER_PREFIX=/the/path/used/as/prefix as an argument on 
     cmake invocation

3.b) Adjust your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to include the 
     folder where tracker-client-0.7.pc is located. Run the command 
     `locate` to figure out where they are.

3.c) adjust your LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting to your tracker installation to
     make sure FSter will properly load them.
