DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to compile and install FSter you need:
  - cmake >= 2.8.0
  - fuse >= 2.8.1
  - tracker-client >= 0.7.11
  - libxml2 >= 2.7.4

INSTALL STEPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to install FSter is:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

The script check for Tracker both in /usr and /usr/local; if you have libraries on a different
path (perhaps using a different prefix in manual compilation and installation) you have to adjust
your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to include the folder where tracker-client-0.7.pc is
located (check for it with `locate`) and pass the option
-DTRACKER_PREFIX=/the/path/used/as/prefix when invoking `cmake ..`.
